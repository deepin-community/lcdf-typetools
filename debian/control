Description: tools for OpenType, multiple-master, and Type 1 fonts
 LCDF Typetools comprises several programs
 for manipulating PostScript Type 1, Type 1 multiple master,
 and OpenType fonts.
 .
 Programs to manipulate OpenType, multiple-master, and Type 1 fonts:
 .
  * cfftot1
    allows you to translate Compact Font Format (CFF)
    or PostScript-flavored OpenType fonts
    into PostScript Type 1 font format.
  * otfinfo
    reports information about OpenType fonts,
    such as the features they support.
    and the contents of their "size" optical size option
  * otftotfm
    allows you to create TeX font metrics and encodings
    for using PostScript-flavored OpenType fonts.
    NB! This tool requires the additional package texlive-binaries.
  * t1dotlessj
    creates a Type 1 font with a single character --
    the dotless j corresponding to the specified design.
  * t1lint
    checks a Type 1 font for correctness
    (preliminary).
  * t1rawafm
    generates a "raw" (kernless and ligatureless) AFM file
    given a font file (PFB/PFA).
  * t1reencode
    changes a PostScript Type 1 font embedded encoding.
  * t1testpage
    creates a PostScript test page for a specified font file
    (preliminary).
  * ttftotype42
    converts TrueType or TrueType-flavored OpenType font programs
    into PostScript Type 42 format.
 .
 LCDF-TypeTools also includes the multiple-master font tools
 allowing you to use multiple-master fonts
 with programs that require single-master fonts
 (afm2tfm, ps2pk, fontinst, etc.).
 Both programs work fine with fonts
 that contain intermediate masters
 (e.g., Adobe Jenson MM and Adobe Kepler MM).
 .
  * mmafm
    creates an AFM (Adobe font metric) file
    corresponding to a single instance of a multiple-master font.
    It reads (and therefore requires) the AMFM and AFM files
    distributed with the font.
  * mmpfb
    creates a normal, single-master font program
    that looks like an instance of a multiple-master font.
    It reads the multiple-master font program in PFA or PFB format.
 .
 LCDF stands for Little Cambridgeport Design Factory.
